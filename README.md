# **Projects**

## IO Science Club
In 2018 I started IO Science Club at the University of Technology in Bialystok. Our goal is to gather people with the passion to earn knowledge, create DIY projects, and discover new things. 
In our team, you can find CNC and 3D printer hobbyists, electronic designers, programmists, IoT passionates, drone and RC pilots, and many others. With our knowledge spread in many topics as well as extensive workshop with tools and CNC machines, we can create incredible projects.
Since the beginning, we have been in many competitions and started projects such as an electric skateboard, solar pannel charging station, electric bike, CNC machine, SCARA robot, and Assistive Device for People with Disabilities. Also, we took part in many university promotional events. 

## OpenStreetMaps coding format
For the purpose of displaying user location on the embedded device, I have designed and implemented OpenStreetMaps coding format. I have created encoder as well as decoder in Python. 

**[Project won the second place in the national competition for the best article about electronics or programming.](https://forbot.pl/forum/topic/19798-przetwarzanie-openstreetmap-na-systemie-wbudowanym-1-format-osm/)**

## Bike computer
The project is in commercialization. I have designed 

## Multifuncitonal CNC machine
I have designed a multifunctional CNC machine that allows to mill, 3D print and laser engrave.
I was presenting the project at Milset Expo-Sciences International in Abu Zabi.


Nowadays I modified the machine only for milling purposes and I am creating injection molding molds.


## Programmable bionic hand
