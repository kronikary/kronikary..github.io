## Multifuncitonal CNC machine
I have designed a multifunctional CNC machine that allows to mill, 3D print and laser engrave.
I was presenting the project at Milset Expo-Sciences International in Abu Zabi.


Nowadays I modified the machine only for milling purposes and I am creating injection molding molds.
